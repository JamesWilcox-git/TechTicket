# TechTicket
Semester project for CEN3031

# CEN3031 Summer 2024 Project Description
Section 20610
Lead TA: Donald Honeycutt

You are tasked with developing an IT help desk ticket system that allows people to submit
tickets for things such as account help and repair requests. The system should support
automatic assignment of tickets to individual IT staff members and have a built-in calendar that
can support the large quantity of tickets our department receives. Additionally, the system
should include both asynchronous and live chat between the ticket submitter and IT staff.
While this system is not required to be developed to be accessed via the web, it must be able to
be run on multiple different machines while accessing a central database (you will run a
database locally for testing and development, but it should function as if you were connecting to
a database on a central server). You will gather more detailed requirements at an upcoming
client meeting with your project manager/TA.
